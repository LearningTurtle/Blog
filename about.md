We are [Tejas](https://tejasvaidhyadev.github.io) and [Nikhil](https://itsShnik.github.io). We are currently senior undergraduates at IIT Kharagpur. We are budding machine learning researchers. It often happens that people neglect the theory behind a concept because it appears difficult. This leads to gaps in theoretical foundation and then negligience in practice. A slight change in perspective can lead the change. We are trying to fill into some of these gaps through intuitive explanation of the concepts. We are also trying to get started with youtube videos on the same.

If you have some suggestions, feedback or maybe some topic that you would like us to write upon, kindly reach out to us at [learningturtle.yt@gmail.com](mailto:learningturtle.yt@gmail.com).
